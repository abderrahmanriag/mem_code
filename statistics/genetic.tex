\subsection{crossover:}
\subsubsection{Chromosome and Bit structure:}
- Get the characteristics of the chromosome and the bit structure:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|l|r|c|}
			\hline
			Cretrea & Chromosome & Bit \tabularnewline
			\hline
			running time & worst & best\tabularnewline
			\hline
			Sort & best & worst \tabularnewline
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Sometimes Chromosome time be the best then the bit time.\\
The items in the each solution are sorted according the efficiency.\\
The chromosome structure does not change the sort of items in the solution, unlike the bit structure.\\
From the above we will choose the structure of the chromosome.
